RELEASE NOTES 
    Version 1, Preliminary Build:
    1.  Character can move above abd below water
	a.	Underwater physics are more "floaty" and allow for greater mobility as long as the player uses the 
		jetpack. Which he does have in this build.
    2.  Placeholder sprites are still used throughout the game
    3.  There are no items/or puzzles included in the game yet (due to programmer schedules)
	The concepts for said items and puzzles are still being formulated.
    4.	The base weapon (the bubble shooter) is equipped to begin with.
    
    5.  Rough game mechanics:
	a. building on this the probable premise of the game is that your player is a scientist
		exploring the ocean flor when his submarine crashes. he then must explore mysretious signals
		calling him to a temple.
        b. Weapons will be: Bubble Gun, Freeze Ray, and a bomb/torpedo
	c. We are trying to avoid puzzles that rely on button pressing or trigger pulling.
		a. Ideas for puzzles are still being considered: we are relatively sure there will be a puzzles
		that involves freezing enemies and then climbing the frozen enemies to a goal.
	d. We have concept some concept art complete for some enemies. 
	e. There will be 3 main stages of the game The first being the crached submarine (half flooded)
	   then an ocean floor stage, followed by a sort of underwater temple endgame with a boss.	
    	f. Music was proposed to be rather ambient/un-nerving
	g. As player becomes more wounded sounds will change - louder breathing noise/heartbeat
