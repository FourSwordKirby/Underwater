These air bombs will be great for blasting rock walls. 
Now that I've hooked them up to my gun, I can hit X or Y to swap modes.Then I hit the B button to drop them. 
Its a good thing I have this diving suit.
Though powerful, these bombs won't hurt me or any of these annoying squids.
I bet if a large one came and ate one though, it'd be really effective.
