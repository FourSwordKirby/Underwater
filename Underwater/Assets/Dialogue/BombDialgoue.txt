Hello, Comrade Housing Minister, and congratulations on new job! 
Today, I will be of teaching you to optimize happiness levels in GLORIOUS SOVIET apartments via new Sudoku Plan!
This resident is filthy capitalist sympathizer who is making this apartment floor too happy! Look at his filthiness with the Right Mouse Button! Cyka blyat idi nahui! 
Notice his cell is deep red. It means cell is extreme needings of communist fervor! Moreso than those of lighter colors.
We must of makings him miserable, for good of State! 
Stick filthy captitalist flag in his room to ruin his day! What? Is Soviet logic!
Horosho, tovarich! Talk about Crime and Punishment! That cheeki breeki will never be of capitalism again! 
Now, see that resident? 
He is loyal member of party, and seems to be in need of cheer! 
In fact, if we don't cheer him up, those in his housing block, row, and column will be less happy!
We cannot allow this inequality to occur. Deploy the happiness balloons!
Hahaha! Excellent, comrade! We have optimized happiness levels in this apartment building! 
Now do so for other housing complexes! But remember, Comrade Housing Minister--the State’s resources are limited! 
You will not havings unlimited modifiers, so make of good use!
