The perfect ice-breaker to any party! 
Triton Corp’s FR-33Z upgrade to the BC-1 Bubble Caster converts output to cold [REDACTED] gas! 
Guaranteed to freeze 99% of small sea life!
Once acquired, the FR-33Z attachment automatically interfaces with your bubble caster.
Simply switch the settings on your bubble caster until you've activated the Ice setting, and fire away.
Remember, freezing takes time so keep the trigger held down! 
And for added fun, you can step on frozen enemies to reach greater heights!
