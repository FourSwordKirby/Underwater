The time I have left here in the depths is uncertain. 
My suit was not built for such extensive time in the depths, and air has managed to escape before it can enter my lungs.
The voice calling me is all I have left to guide me. Though the current is strong, and my weights are lost to the sea.
The populations of fish grow denser. They hunger for my flesh.
